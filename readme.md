<h1>Divine Stays Single Page Application</h1>
<h2>Welcome to the Divine Stays Repository, Thanks for being here!</h2>

- The brief was to create a single page application to promote Tourism NZs new campaign
- The app had to include inputs the user could enter information into
- The app had to validate the information
- Accomodation options based on the users inputs were to appear fitting the users needs
- The app also needed to be responsive and only be single page
- This meant using modals and a swiper to achieve the final result
